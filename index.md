# News

* Nov'21: Our [XAIT](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/xait-lab?languageSelect=UK&searchCriteria[0][key]=keywords&searchCriteria[0][values][]=XAITLab&searchCriteria[1][key]=Resultsperpage&searchCriteria[1][values][]=50) lab on Explainable AI/ML/Optimisation in Civil Engineering has been funded! We are in the process of hiring four PhD students.
* Oct'21: Co-chaired the workshop on [Constraint Modelling and Reformulation (ModRef'21)](https://modref.github.io/ModRef2021.html) together with Dr Graeme Gange.
* Sep'21: Released [MurTree code](https://bitbucket.org/EmirD/murtree) for constructing optimal decision trees. Read our [JMLR paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/20-520.html) for details.
* Jul'21: [Loandra](https://github.com/jezberg/loandra), our MaxSAT solver developed in collaboration with Jeremias Berg and Peter J. Stuckey, has scored first place in the _incomplete weighted 300 seconds_ track of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2021! This is the third year in a row to show top performance. The main ingredients of the solver are [core-boosting](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jezberg/papers/CPAIOR2019_Berg_Demirovic_Stuckey.pdf) (CPAIOR'19) and [varying resolution and solution-guided search](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30048-7_11) (CP'19).

# Open positions

Are you a TU Delft student looking for a side-job, i.e., one day per week during the semester or a few days a week over the summer break? Can you come up with algorithmic solutions and implement them efficiently in C++? Get in touch!

# About Me

I work in automated decision-making, focussing on combinatorial optimisation, machine learning, and the integration thereof. My long term vision is to create algorithms that automate any sort of decision making that is currently done by humans, typically referring to scenarios where difficult decision making has to be done in the presence of large and complex constraints.

Prior to my appointment as an assistant professor in the [Algorithmics group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/algorithmics/) at TU Delft, I was an associate lecturer and postdoctoral researcher (research fellow) at the University of Melbourne in Australia (2017-2020) working with Professors Peter J. Stuckey, James Bailey, Rao Kotagiri, Christopher Leckie, and Dr Jeffrey Chan. I received my PhD from the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) in 2017 under the supervision of Priv. Dozent Dr Nysret Musliu. In between these positions I held shorter term posts at a production planning and scheduling company MCP (Vienna, Austria) and the National Institute of Informatics (Toyko, Japan) with Professor Katsumi Inoue.

# Research

My work can be partitioned into several research directions, all revolving around a central theme of combinatorial optimisation and artificial intelligence. The goals of my research can be summarised as follows.

* Advance general-purpose problem-solving techniques based on propositional logic (MaxSAT) and constraint programming.
* Develop specialised combinatorial optimisation algorithms for trustworthy machine learning.
* Enable machine learning algorithms to directly reason over combinatorial optimisation problems (predict+optimise).
* Develop the theory and algorithms for resilient and multi-objective optimisation.
* Apply advanced algorithms to real-world problems.
