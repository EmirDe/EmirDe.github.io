* Postdoc opening on combinatorial optimisation for real-world problems! Application deadline: October 16.
* Released MurTree code for constructing optimal decision trees. Read the paper for details.

# About Me

I work in automated decision-making, focussing on combinatorial optimisation, machine learning, and the integration thereof. My long term vision is to create algorithms that automate any sort of decision making that is currently done by humans, typically referring to scenarios where difficult decision making has to be done in the presence of large and complex constraints.

Prior to my post at TU Delft, I was an associate lecturer and postdoctoral researcher (research fellow) at the University of Melbourne in Australia (2017-2020) working with Professors Peter J. Stuckey, James Bailey, Rao Kotagiri, Christopher Leckie, and Dr Jeffrey Chan. I received my PhD from the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) in 2017 under the supervision of Priv. Dozent Dr Nysret Musliu. In between these positions I held shorter terms posts at a production planning and scheduling company MCP (Vienna, Austria) and the National Institute of Informatics (Toyko, Japan) with Professor Katsumi Inoue.

# Research

My work can be partitioned into several research directions, all revolving around a central theme of combinatorial optimisation and artificial intelligence. The goals of my research can be summarised as follows.

* Advance general-purpose problem-solving techniques based on constraint programming and propositional logic (MaxSAT).
* Develop specialised combinatorial optimisation algorithms for trustworthy machine learning.
* Enable machine learning algorithms to directly reason over combinatorial optimisation problems.
* Develop the theory and algorithms for resilient and multi-objective optimisation.
* Apply advanced algorithms to real-world problems.
